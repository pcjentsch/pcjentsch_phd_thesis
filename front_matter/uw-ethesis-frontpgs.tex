  \begin{itemize}
    
   \item Chapter \ref{ch1}: MA and CTB conceptualised the study. All authors designed the model. PCJ developed and analysed the model and generated figures. PCJ and CTB wrote the first draft of the manuscript and accessed and verified the data. All authors revised the manuscript critically for important intellectual content, and read and approved the final version of the manuscript. All authors had full access to all the data in the study, and the corresponding author had final responsibility for the decision to submit for publication. The contents of this chapter are based on the corresponding article published in \textit{Lancet Infectious Diseases} \cite{jentsch2021prioritising}.
   
   \item Chapter \ref{ch2}: Conceptualization by DY, MA, data curation by PCJ, DY, formal analysis by PCJ, funding acquisition by CTB, DY, MA, investigation by PCJ, CTB, DY, MA. Methodology by PCJ, CTB, DY, MA. Project administration by PCJ, CTB, DY, MA. Resources by CTB, DY, MA. Software written by PCJ. Supervision by CTB, DY, MA, validation by PCJ, CTB, DY, MA, visualization by PCJ, CTB. Original draft written by PCJ. Review & editing by PCJ, CTB, DY, MA.
